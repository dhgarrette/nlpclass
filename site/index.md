title: Natural Language Processing
---

## Overview

In the age of the Internet, there is a considerable demand for technology helping users to manage, search and access the enormous amount of information that is available. There is also a need for speech interfaces to computer systems of various types, from tutoring systems to automated customer support lines to robots. Examples of language-technological applications are the identification of the correct sense of an ambiguous word like “bass” (fish or musical instrument), automatic recognition of the language in which a document is written, machine translation, and automatic extraction of information from documents.

The field of computational linguistics deals with both the science behind providing such capabilities and the actual creation of applications which implement them. This course discusses the main natural language processing applications and provides an introduction to the key representations and algorithms used in computational linguistics and to the use of machine learning for NLP tasks.

The course will be oriented towards hands-on experience of language processing techniques. Previous programming experience is required.
